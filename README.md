# School_District_Analysis
Pandas Python

Write a few sentences to describe any discoveries that you made while performing your analysis. 
Maria needed data to be analyzed to fix the school budget. She got the new data set. 
Now to analyze this data I used three phase analysis 
1.	For deliverable 1
-	 Imported data into the data Frame
-	Verified data to see if all data is properly imported. 
2.	Using deliverable 2 - 
-	Prepared and clean data for analysis. 
-	By removing duplicates, NaN and checking correct data type, we prepared data for further analysis. 
3.	In Deliverable 3 : 
-	Summarized data to understand the statistics.
-	Maria needs math_score and reading_score for all grades , to work on budget. 
4.	Now in deliverable 4 : 
-	Actual drilling or analysis of data process started. 
-	We used selected columns and did calculations and sorted data school wise , grade wise. 
-	This will help Maria to create budget more elaboratively gradewise and school wise on basis of their focus requirement. 


Include any additional analysis that you believe would be worthwhile.

By doing this Challenge, I practiced about how in real world, we need to work on data in Pandas environment by using three phase process. 
This data analysis will help Maria to find out and focus on school wise , grade wise , and also help her to create budget accordingly.
